For syscall 378 and 379 (set_light_intensity, get_light_intensity), we used a
global variable 'intensity' to store the value. And we implemented the function
by setting/getting the variable using copy_from_user and copy_to_user. We also
added a reader writer lock to make it thread safe.

For syscall 380 to 383, we used idr to store the event_id table. We used a
spinlock to protect the idr table. Also there's a global variable
'light_history[WINDOW]' which stores the last WINDOW records we got from
syscall 382 (light_evt_signal). We used another reader writer lock to protect
it.
