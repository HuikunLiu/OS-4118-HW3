TODO

- add read/write lock in kernel/light.c for history record?
- make light_d a daemon, remeber to call syscall 378 and 382
- run style checker
- clean test/test.c
- test on emulator

TO FIX

When calling light_evt_destroy(), it should wake up the processes in the queue
that wait on the event. A possible way to implement tihs is waking up every
process, which is inefficient.

idr_remove() will free the memory.
